# DKAN Frontend Theme (Bartik)

This is a Bartik sub-theme for [DKAN](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan) that disables 
libraries on DKAN frontend paths, to avoid style collisions. It assumes you have
DKAN's dkan_js_frontend module enabled, and are building 
[DKAN Catalog App](https://github.com/GetDKAN/data-catalog-app) or something derivative
of that as a decoupled frontend.

This theme will currently be installed if you follow the 
[standard project creation process](https://demo.getdkan.org/modules/contrib/dkan/docs/start.html). 
However, Bartik has been deprecated in Drupal core, so DKAN is working on an alternative frontend 
approach going forward.
