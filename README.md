# DKAN Frontend Theme (Bartik)

This is a Bartik sub-theme for [DKAN](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan) that disables 
libraries on DKAN frontend paths, to avoid style collisions. It assumes you have
DKAN's dkan_js_frontend module enabled, and are building 
[DKAN Catalog App](https://github.com/GetDKAN/data-catalog-app) or something derivative
of that as a decoupled frontend.

Further documentation on this setup coming soon, but this theme will be installed
if you follow the 
[DKAN Tools standard project creation process](https://getdkan.github.io/dkan-tools/#newproject.html).
